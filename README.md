## What You'll Learn

- The basics of building a One-Time Password (OTP) UI Component with React and TypeScript.
- How to leverage React Hook Form and Zod for front-end UI validation.
- How to use Jest to test user interactions with your component.
- **Bonus:** How to mock AWS Amplify API calls.
  - While this is not necessary, I built this original component while leveraging AWS Amplify, and testing/mocking it has very little documentation.
